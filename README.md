# React Dashboard

## Project Overview

This interactive web application, built with React.js and D3.js, visualizes key regional indicators across three major categories: Community, Transportation, and Economy. Designed for intuitive exploration and data-driven storytelling, the dashboard enables users to understand local trends and patterns through responsive, visually compelling charts.

## Categories & Indicators

### Community
- Educational Attainment: Track changes in high school and college graduation rates over time.
- Population Growth: Analyze demographic shifts across counties or metro areas.

### Transportation
- Bridge Conditions: Visualize the percentage of structurally deficient bridges and maintenance trends.
- Commute Mode: Compare how residents travel (car, transit, biking, walking) across regions.
- Miles Driven: View trends in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) as a proxy for mobility and congestion.

### Economy
- Business Formation: See how new business registrations have changed over time.
-Job Growth: Examine employment trends and industry-level workforce expansion.

## Features
- Built with React.js for dynamic component rendering and smooth user interaction.
- Uses D3.js for custom SVG-based charts including line graphs, bar charts, and stacked area visuals.
- Filters for time range and geography allow tailored exploration of the data.
- Responsive layout adapts to desktop and mobile devices for accessibility.
- This app provides policymakers, planners, and the public with a clear, interactive window into the health and evolution of their region.
